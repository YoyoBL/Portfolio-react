            Utilizing Node.js, I engineered robust endpoints and a dynamic
            backend structure to complement the BizCard frontend. <br />
            Seamlessly integrating with MongoDB via Mongoose, all data is
            securely stored. Leveraging a multitude of libraries including
            Express for routing, Bcrypt for password encryption, and JWT for
            token security, I've ensured top-notch protection.
            <br />
            Furthermore, I've enhanced the development process with Chalk for
            colorful console logs and implemented an error-handling system that
            autonomously generates log files, ensuring smooth operation even in
            the face of challenges.
